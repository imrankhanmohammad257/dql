  },
{
    "question": "1. What is Jenkins?",
    "answer": "Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) to automate building, testing, and deploying applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "2. What are the main features of Jenkins?",
    "answer": "Key features include easy installation, extensible via plugins, distributed builds, support for multiple languages, and easy integration with version control systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "3. What is a Jenkins pipeline?",
    "answer": "A Jenkins pipeline is a set of automated steps defined in a script to build, test, and deploy an application, typically written in Groovy using a Jenkinsfile."
  },
  {
    "question": "4. Difference between freestyle job and pipeline job?",
    "answer": "Freestyle jobs are basic jobs with simple configuration, whereas pipeline jobs provide complex automation using code and allow multi-step workflows and stages."
  },
  {
    "question": "5. What is a Jenkinsfile?",
    "answer": "A Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins pipeline, specifying stages, steps, and other pipeline configurations."
  },
  {
    "question": "6. Difference between declarative and scripted pipeline?",
    "answer": "Declarative pipelines provide a simpler, structured syntax; scripted pipelines offer more flexibility using Groovy scripting for complex scenarios."
  },
  {
    "question": "7. What are Jenkins plugins?",
    "answer": "Plugins extend Jenkins functionality by integrating with tools like Git, Maven, Docker, Slack, and allow customization of Jenkins workflows."
  },
  {
    "question": "8. Explain Jenkins master-slave architecture.",
    "answer": "Master manages jobs and schedules builds. Slaves are distributed nodes that execute build tasks assigned by the master to distribute workload."
  },
  {
    "question": "9. How do you trigger a Jenkins job?",
    "answer": "Jobs can be triggered manually, periodically using cron, via SCM changes, build completion of another job, or through REST API calls."
  },
  {
    "question": "10. What is a Jenkins workspace?",
    "answer": "The workspace is a directory on the build node where Jenkins checks out the source code and performs all build and test operations."
  },
  {
    "question": "11. What is continuous integration?",
    "answer": "Continuous integration is a practice where developers frequently integrate code into a shared repository, and each integration is automatically built and tested."
  },
  {
    "question": "12. Continuous delivery vs continuous deployment?",
    "answer": "Continuous delivery ensures code is always deployable, while continuous deployment automatically releases every change passing all tests to production."
  },
  {
    "question": "13. How do you secure Jenkins?",
    "answer": "Security includes authentication, authorization (roles or matrix-based), SSL, restricting access to jobs, and credentials management for sensitive data."
  },
  {
    "question": "14. Difference between Build, Build with Parameters, and Trigger builds remotely?",
